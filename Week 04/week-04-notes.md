## Week 4: Priority Queues

We introduce the priority queue data type and an efficient implementation using the *binary heap* data structure. This implementation also leads to an efficient sorting algorithm known as *heapsort*. We conclude with an applications of priority queues where we simulate the motion of *N* particles subject to the laws of elastic collision.
