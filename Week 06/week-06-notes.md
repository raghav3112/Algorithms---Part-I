## Week 6: Hash Tables

> We begin by describing the desirable properties of hash function and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the *uniform hashing assumption* that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tablesâ€”*separate chaining* and *linear probing*. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption. We conclude with applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors.

### Hash Tables
* Another approach to implementing symbol tables that can also be very effective in a practical application is hashing
* Hashing involves using a **hash function** - a method for computing array index from a key
* When using a hash function we want to scramble the keys uniformly to produce a table index:
  * Efficiently computable
  * Each table index equally likely for each key
* Some examples of bad hashing:
  * Using the first three digits of a phone number
  * Using the first three digits of SSN
* Some examples of good hashing:
  * Using the last digits of a phone number or SSN
* We also need a different approach for each key type
* All Java classes inherit a method `hashCode()` which returns a 32-bit `int`
* In general if `x.equals(y)`, then `(x.hashCode() == y.hashCode())`
* It is highly desirable to have `!x.equals(y)`, then `(x.hashCode() != y.hashCode())`
* The default implementation for `hashCode()` uses the memory address of x

* Java implementation is different for `Integer`, `Boolean`, `Double`, etc. below is an implementation of `hashCode()` for the `Integer` type:
```java
public final class Integer {
  private final int value {
    // ...
    public int hashCode() {
      return value;
    }
  }
}
```

* The standard recipe for hash code design is as follows:
  * Combine each significant field using the *31 * x + y* rule
  * If field is a primitive type, use wrapper type `hashCode()`
  * If field is null, return `0`
  * If field is a reference type, use `hashCode()`
  * If field is an array, apply to each entry

### Separate Chaining
* Separate chaining is a collision red solution strategy that makes use of elementary linked list
* During a collision, two distinct keys hashing to same index:
  * Birthday problem - can't avoid collisions unless you have a ridiculous (quadratic) amount of memory
  * Coupon collector + load balancing - collisions will be evenly distributed
* How do we deal with collisions efficiently?
  * Use an array of *M < N* linked lists:
    * Hash: map key to integer *i* between *0* and *M - 1*
    * Insert: put at front of *ith* chain (if not already there)
    * Search: need to search only *ith* chain

* Separate chaining implementation in Java is as follows:
```java
public class SeparateChainHashST<Key, Value> {
  // NOTE: Array doubling and halving code omitted
  private int M = 97; // Number of chains
  private Node[] st = new Node[M]; // Array of chains

  private static class Node {
    private Object key; // No generic array creation
    private Object val; // Declare key and value of type Object
    private Node next;
    // ...
  }

  public Value get(Key key) {
    int i = hash(key);
    for (Node x = st[i]; x != null; x = x.next) {
      if (key.equals(x.key)) {
        return (Value) x.val;
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

* For insertion the code becomes:
```java
public class SeparateChainHashST<Key, Value> {
  // NOTE: Array doubling and halving code omitted
  private int M = 97; // Number of chains
  private Node[] st = new Node[M]; // Array of chains

  private static class Node {
    private Object key; // No generic array creation
    private Object val; // Declare key and value of type Object
    private Node next;
    // ...
  }

  public void put(Key key, Value val) {
    int i = hash(key);
    for (Node x = st[i]; x != null; x = x.next) {
      if (key.equals(x.key)) {
        x.val = val;
        return;
      }
    }
    st[i] = new Node(key, val, st[i]);
  }
}
```

* The number of probes (`equals()` and `hashCode()`) for search/insert is proportional to *N / M*:
  * *M* too large -> too many empty chains
  * *M* too small -> chains too long
  * Typical choice: *M ~ N / 5* -> constant-time operation

### Linear Probing
* Another closure resolution method is known as linear probing
* Linear probing is also known as *open addressing* - when a new key collides, find next empty slot, and put it there
* The methods for linear probing for hash tables is as follows:
  * **Hash** - map key to integer *i* between *0* and *M - 1*
  * **Insert** - put a table at index *i* if free; if not try *i + 1*, *i + 2*, etc.
  * **Search** - search table index *i*; if occupied but no match, try *i + 1*, *i + 2*, etc.
  * Note: array size *M* **must be** greater than number of key-value pairs *N*

* The Java implementation for linear probing:
```java
public class LinearProbingHashST<Key, Value> {
  // NOTE: Array doubling and halving code omitted
  private int M = 30001;
  private Value[] vals = (Value[]) new Object[M];
  private Key[] keys = (Key[]) new Object[M];

  private int hash(Key key) {
    /* as before */
  }

  private void put (Key key, Value val) {
    int i;
    for (i = hash(key); keys[i] != null; i = (i + 1) % M) {
      if (keys[i].equals(key)) {
        break;
      }
    }
    keys[i] = key;
    vals[i] = val;
  }

  private Value get(Key key) {
    for (int i = hash(key); keys[i] != null; i = (i + 1) % M) {
      if (key.equals(keys[i])) {
        return vals[i];
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

* Clustering became a problem:
  * **Cluster** - a contiguous block of items
  * **Observation** - new keys likely to hash into middle of big clusters
* Under uniform hashing assumption, the average of number of probes in a linear probing hash table of size *M* that contains *N = a * M* keys is:
  * Search hit ~ *(1 / 2) * (1 + (1 / (1 - a)))*
  * Search miss/insert ~ *(1 / 2) * (1 + (1 / (1 - a)^2))*
* In summary, for linear probing:
  * *M* too large -> too many empty array entries
  * *M* too small -> search time blows up
  * Typical choice: *a ~ N / M ~ 1/2* -> constant-time operation

### Hash Table Context
* For `String` `hashCode()` in Java 1.1:
  * Only examine 8-9 evenly spaced characters for long strings
  * The benefit is saving time in performing arithmetic

* An implementation of `hashCode()` in Java:
```java
public int hashCode() {
  int hash = 0;
  int skip = Math.max(1, length() / 8);
  for (int i = 0; i < length(); i += skip) {
    hash = s[i] + (37 * hash);
  }
  return hash;
}
```

* However, there was great potential for bad collision patterns

* Separate chaining versus linear probing:
  * **Separate chaining**:
    * Easier to implement delete
    * Performance degrades gracefully
    * Clustering less sensitive to poorly-designed hash function
  * **Linear probing**:
    * Less wasted space
    * Better cache performance

* Hash tables versus balanced search trees:
  * **Hash tables**:
    * Simpler to code
    * No effective alternative for unordered keys
    * Faster for simple keys (a few arithmetic operations versus *log(N)* compares)
    * Better system support in Java for strings (e.g. cache hash code)
  * **Balanced search trees**:
    * Stronger performance guarantee
    * Support for ordered ST (search tree) operations
    * Easier to implement `compareTo()` correctly than `equals()` and `hashCode()`

## Week 6: Symbol Table Applications

This section will cover topics (optional) on symbol table applications including *sets*, *dictionary clients*, *indexing clients*, and *sparse vectors*

### Sets
* Mathematically, sets are a collection of distinct keys
* To implement a set:
  * Read in a list of words from one file
  * Print out all words from standard input that are { in, not in } the list

* An example of such implementation in the real world is a *whitelist*:
```java
public class WhiteList {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create empty set of strings
    SET<String> set = new SET<String>();
    // Read in whitelist
    In in = new In(args[0]);
    while (!in.isEmpty()) {
      set.add(in.readString());
    }
    // Print words in list
    while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) {
      String word = StdIn.readString();
      if (set.contains(word)) {
        StdOut.println(word);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Conversely, there is also a *blacklist* implementation:
```java
public class BlackList {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create empty set of strings
    SET<String> set = new SET<String>();
    // Read in blacklist
    In in = new In(args[0]);
    while (!in.isEmpty()) {
      set.add(in.readString());
    }
    // Print words not in list
    while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) {
      String word = StdIn.readString();
      if (!set.contains(word)) {
        StdOut.println(word);
      }
    }
  }
}
```
