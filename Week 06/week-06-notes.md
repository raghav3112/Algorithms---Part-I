## Week 6: Hash Tables

> We begin by describing the desirable properties of hash function and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the _uniform hashing assumption_ that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tablesâ€”_separate chaining_ and _linear probing_. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption. We conclude with applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors.

### Hash Tables

- Another approach to implementing symbol tables that can also be very effective in a practical application is hashing
- Hashing involves using a **hash function** - a method for computing array index from a key
- When using a hash function we want to scramble the keys uniformly to produce a table index:
  - Efficiently computable
  - Each table index equally likely for each key
- Some examples of bad hashing:
  - Using the first three digits of a phone number
  - Using the first three digits of SSN
- Some examples of good hashing:
  - Using the last digits of a phone number or SSN
- We also need a different approach for each key type
- All Java classes inherit a method `hashCode()` which returns a 32-bit `int`
- In general if `x.equals(y)`, then `(x.hashCode() == y.hashCode())`
- It is highly desirable to have `!x.equals(y)`, then `(x.hashCode() != y.hashCode())`
- The default implementation for `hashCode()` uses the memory address of x

- Java implementation is different for `Integer`, `Boolean`, `Double`, etc. below is an implementation of `hashCode()` for the `Integer` type:

```java
public final class Integer {
  private final int value {
    // ...
    public int hashCode() {
      return value;
    }
  }
}
```

- The standard recipe for hash code design is as follows:
  - Combine each significant field using the _31 _ x + y\* rule
  - If field is a primitive type, use wrapper type `hashCode()`
  - If field is null, return `0`
  - If field is a reference type, use `hashCode()`
  - If field is an array, apply to each entry

### Separate Chaining

- Separate chaining is a collision red solution strategy that makes use of elementary linked list
- During a collision, two distinct keys hashing to same index:
  - Birthday problem - can't avoid collisions unless you have a ridiculous (quadratic) amount of memory
  - Coupon collector + load balancing - collisions will be evenly distributed
- How do we deal with collisions efficiently?

  - Use an array of _M < N_ linked lists:
    - Hash: map key to integer _i_ between _0_ and _M - 1_
    - Insert: put at front of _ith_ chain (if not already there)
    - Search: need to search only _ith_ chain

- Separate chaining implementation in Java is as follows:

```java
public class SeparateChainHashST<Key, Value> {
  // NOTE: Array doubling and halving code omitted
  private int M = 97; // Number of chains
  private Node[] st = new Node[M]; // Array of chains

  private static class Node {
    private Object key; // No generic array creation
    private Object val; // Declare key and value of type Object
    private Node next;
    // ...
  }

  public Value get(Key key) {
    int i = hash(key);
    for (Node x = st[i]; x != null; x = x.next) {
      if (key.equals(x.key)) {
        return (Value) x.val;
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

- For insertion the code becomes:

```java
public class SeparateChainHashST<Key, Value> {
  // NOTE: Array doubling and halving code omitted
  private int M = 97; // Number of chains
  private Node[] st = new Node[M]; // Array of chains

  private static class Node {
    private Object key; // No generic array creation
    private Object val; // Declare key and value of type Object
    private Node next;
    // ...
  }

  public void put(Key key, Value val) {
    int i = hash(key);
    for (Node x = st[i]; x != null; x = x.next) {
      if (key.equals(x.key)) {
        x.val = val;
        return;
      }
    }
    st[i] = new Node(key, val, st[i]);
  }
}
```

- The number of probes (`equals()` and `hashCode()`) for search/insert is proportional to _N / M_:
  - _M_ too large -> too many empty chains
  - _M_ too small -> chains too long
  - Typical choice: _M ~ N / 5_ -> constant-time operation

### Linear Probing

- Another closure resolution method is known as linear probing
- Linear probing is also known as _open addressing_ - when a new key collides, find next empty slot, and put it there
- The methods for linear probing for hash tables is as follows:

  - **Hash** - map key to integer _i_ between _0_ and _M - 1_
  - **Insert** - put a table at index _i_ if free; if not try _i + 1_, _i + 2_, etc.
  - **Search** - search table index _i_; if occupied but no match, try _i + 1_, _i + 2_, etc.
  - Note: array size _M_ **must be** greater than number of key-value pairs _N_

- The Java implementation for linear probing:

```java
public class LinearProbingHashST<Key, Value> {
  // NOTE: Array doubling and halving code omitted
  private int M = 30001;
  private Value[] vals = (Value[]) new Object[M];
  private Key[] keys = (Key[]) new Object[M];

  private int hash(Key key) {
    /* as before */
  }

  private void put (Key key, Value val) {
    int i;
    for (i = hash(key); keys[i] != null; i = (i + 1) % M) {
      if (keys[i].equals(key)) {
        break;
      }
    }
    keys[i] = key;
    vals[i] = val;
  }

  private Value get(Key key) {
    for (int i = hash(key); keys[i] != null; i = (i + 1) % M) {
      if (key.equals(keys[i])) {
        return vals[i];
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

- Clustering became a problem:
  - **Cluster** - a contiguous block of items
  - **Observation** - new keys likely to hash into middle of big clusters
- Under uniform hashing assumption, the average of number of probes in a linear probing hash table of size _M_ that contains _N = a _ M\* keys is:
  - Search hit ~ _(1 / 2) _ (1 + (1 / (1 - a)))\*
  - Search miss/insert ~ _(1 / 2) _ (1 + (1 / (1 - a)^2))\*
- In summary, for linear probing:
  - _M_ too large -> too many empty array entries
  - _M_ too small -> search time blows up
  - Typical choice: _a ~ N / M ~ 1/2_ -> constant-time operation

### Hash Table Context

- For `String` `hashCode()` in Java 1.1:

  - Only examine 8-9 evenly spaced characters for long strings
  - The benefit is saving time in performing arithmetic

- An implementation of `hashCode()` in Java:

```java
public int hashCode() {
  int hash = 0;
  int skip = Math.max(1, length() / 8);
  for (int i = 0; i < length(); i += skip) {
    hash = s[i] + (37 * hash);
  }
  return hash;
}
```

- However, there was great potential for bad collision patterns

- Separate chaining versus linear probing:

  - **Separate chaining**:
    - Easier to implement delete
    - Performance degrades gracefully
    - Clustering less sensitive to poorly-designed hash function
  - **Linear probing**:
    - Less wasted space
    - Better cache performance

- Hash tables versus balanced search trees:
  - **Hash tables**:
    - Simpler to code
    - No effective alternative for unordered keys
    - Faster for simple keys (a few arithmetic operations versus _log(N)_ compares)
    - Better system support in Java for strings (e.g. cache hash code)
  - **Balanced search trees**:
    - Stronger performance guarantee
    - Support for ordered ST (symbol table) operations
    - Easier to implement `compareTo()` correctly than `equals()` and `hashCode()`

## Week 6: Symbol Table Applications

This section will cover topics (optional) on symbol table applications including _sets_, _dictionary clients_, _indexing clients_, and _sparse vectors_

### Sets

- Mathematically, sets are a collection of distinct keys
- To implement a set:

  - Read in a list of words from one file
  - Print out all words from standard input that are { in, not in } the list

- An example of such implementation in the real world is a _whitelist_:

```java
public class WhiteList {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create empty set of strings
    SET<String> set = new SET<String>();

    // Read in whitelist
    In in = new In(args[0]);
    while (!in.isEmpty()) {
      set.add(in.readString());
    }

    // Print words in list
    while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) {
      String word = StdIn.readString();
      if (set.contains(word)) {
        StdOut.println(word);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Conversely, there is also a _blacklist_ implementation:

```java
public class BlackList {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create empty set of strings
    SET<String> set = new SET<String>();

    // Read in blacklist
    In in = new In(args[0]);
    while (!in.isEmpty()) {
      set.add(in.readString());
    }

    // Print words not in list
    while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) {
      String word = StdIn.readString();
      if (!set.contains(word)) {
        StdOut.println(word);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Dictionary Clients

- Dictionary clients refer to the dictionary lookup problem:
  - A comma-separated value (CSV) file
  - Key field
  - Value field
- Example of such a problem in practice include DNS lookups, amino acids, and class lists

- Below is an example of a dictionary lookup in a CSV file:

```java
public class LookupCSV {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Process input file
    In in = new In(args[0]);
    int keyField = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
    int valField = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);

    // Build symbol table
    ST<String, String> st = new ST<String, String>();
    while (!in.isEmpty()) {
      String line = in.readLine();
      String[] tokens = line.split(",");
      String key = tokens[keyField];
      String val = tokens[valField];
      st.put(key, val);
    }

    // Process lookups with standard I/O
    while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) {
      String s = StdIn.readString();
      if (!st.contains(s)) {
        StdOut.println("Not found");
      } else {
        StdOut.println(st.get(s));
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Indexing Clients

- Indexing clients refer to the file indexing problem:

  - Our goal is to index a PC or the web
  - Given a list of files specified, create an index so that you can efficiently find all files containing a given query string
  - Solution: key = query string, value = set of files containing that string

- Below is an example of the file indexing implementation:

```java
import java.io.file;
public class FileIndex {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Symbol table
    ST<String, SET<File>> st = new ST<String, SET<File>>();

    // List of file names from command line
    for (String filename : args) {
      File file = new File(filename);
      In in = new In(file);
      // For each word in file, add file to corresponding set
      while (!in.isEmpty()) {
        String key = in.readString();
        if (!st.contains(key)) {
          st.put(key, new SET<File>());
        }
        SET<File> set = st.get(key);
        set.add(file);
      }
    }

    // Process queries
    while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) {
      String query = StdIn.readString();
      StdOut.println(st.get(query));
    }
  }
}
```

### Sparse Vectors

- For nested loops the running time is _N^2_, how do we address this issue for matrices and matrix multiplication?
  - Use symbol tables!
- The standard representation of a vector is done using a 1D array:
  - Constant time access to elements
  - Space proportional to _N_
- The symbol table representation for a vector could be as follows:

  - Key = index, value = entry
  - Efficient iterator
  - Space proportional to number of non-zeroes

- The implementation in java is as follows:

```java
public class SparseVector {
  // HashST because order not important
  private HashST<Integer, Double> v;

  // Empty ST represents all zeros vector
  public SparseVector() {
    v = new HashST<Integer, Double>();
  }

  // a[i] = value
  public void put (int i, double x) {
    v.put(i, x);
  }

  // Return a[i]
  public double get(int i) {
    if (!v.contains(i)) {
      return 0.0;
    } else {
      return v.get(i);
    }
  }

  public Iterable<Integer> indices() {
    return v.keys();
  }

  // Dot product is constant time for sparse vectors
  public double dot(double[] that) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (int i : indices()) {
      sum += that[i] * this.get(i);
    }
    return sum;
  }
}
```

- For 2D arrays, the standard matrix representation is:
  - Each row of matrix is an **array**
  - Constant time access to elements
  - Space proportional to _N^2_
- The sparse matrix representation is as follows:

  - Each row of matrix is a **sparse vector**
  - Efficient access to elements
  - Space proportional to number of non-zeroes plus _N_

- The code for 1D sparse vector just needs the following:

```java
// ...
SparseVector[] a = new SparseVector[N];
double[] x = new double[N];
double[] b = new double[N];
// ...
// Initialize a[] and x[]
// ...
// Linear running time for sparse matrix
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  b[i] = a[i].dot(x);
}
```
